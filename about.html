        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Having always been passionate about electronics (I built my first guitar distortion from spare radio parts housed in a coffee jar), I became fascinated with computers at a young age and started coding during the early '80s using BASIC on a Commodore VIC 20 and later a C64. I continued the same path on ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga 500 and finally on the "more advanced" 286-based PCs. Later on I started using Apple Macs such as the Macintosh II, the Mac Classic, Quadra 800, and LC III. My first Mac (which I own and still works today!) was a PowerPC 7600 with 64MB of RAM and a PowerPC 604 CPU running at a whopping 132MHz! :)</p>
        <p>I graduated in Graphic Design Studies in Rome, after which I started working on several print and early web/interactive projects. During breaks from design-related jobs, I worked on anything that would further my experience in other areas. From bartending to gas pump attendant, from welding safety boat launch cranes on large cruise ships being built in shipyards, to co-owning of one the first cyber-cafes in the south of Spain.</p>
        <p>At the start of the new millennium, I moved to New York City where I've been working ever since in the design field for web, interactive, and multimedia projects. In those early days I had the very good fortune to work in the entertainment industry field which also gave me the welcome chance to familiarize myself with a relatively relaxed corporate environment while furthering my professional experience. In the following years I kept working as a graphic and web designer participating in the design and production of several web and flash-based interactive projects, while growing my professional experience in web developmentas well as getting more acquainted with the LAMP stack and CMS system based on it.</p>
        <p>More recently I've worked as a front end developer using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery (for web, email and more), Content Manager, as a freelance consultant on design and production for luxury products and large advertisement agencies working for well known pharma clients. At the same time I always cherish the ability to work on smaller projects for local companies and professionals, which is something I love to do whenver an opportunity arises.</p>
